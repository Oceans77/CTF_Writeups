# DISCORD SHENANIGANS V3

Challenge Description:
> Oh, look who's back for more chaotic fun! The annual wild ride of DISCORD SHENANIGANS V3 is live, and this time we're serving a delicious dish of digital disorder, courtesy of our mischievous Discord bot.
> For those with a discerning eye and a knack for unscrambling the scrambled, this game is your pixelated playground. The flag, you ask? Well, it's tucked away in a place that's right in front of you, yet often overlooked.
> Seek the unseen, unravel the unexpected, and let the shenanigans begin!

This challenge is completed by looking around the discord server (many many times...)

Ultimately this challenge was solved by getting the profile picture of "TFC CTF" bot
All I did to solve this was grab the bot's user ID (905518062084714566) and do a [Discord Lookup](https://id.nerrix.ovh/)

Download and view the profile picture, the flag is in the top left hand side of the picture, Discord slightly crops out profile pictures, so this was clever

Flag: `TFCCTF{wh47_4r3_y0u_d0ing_h3r3!?}`
